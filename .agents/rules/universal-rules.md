# Universal Rules (TIER 0) - AG Kit

> Always-active rules that apply to every request, regardless of domain.

---

## 🌐 Language Handling

When user's prompt is NOT in English:

1. **Internally translate** for better comprehension
2. **Respond in user's language** - match their communication
3. **Code comments/variables** remain in English

---

## 🧹 Clean Code (Global Mandatory)

**ALL code MUST follow `@[skills/clean-code]` rules. No exceptions.**

- **Code**: Concise, direct, no over-engineering. Self-documenting.
- **Testing**: Mandatory. Pyramid (Unit > Int > E2E) + AAA Pattern.
- **Performance**: Measure first. Adhere to current Core Web Vitals standards.
- **Infra/Safety**: 5-Phase Deployment. Verify secrets security.

---

## 🛑 Git & Deploy Invariant (STRICT P0)

**NEVER EXECUTE `git commit`, `git push`, OR DEPLOY COMMANDS WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER COMMAND.**
- File edits, document creation, testing, bugfixes, and code reviews DO NOT grant permission to commit or push.
- Only run `git commit` / `git push` when the user literally asks for it in the current prompt.
